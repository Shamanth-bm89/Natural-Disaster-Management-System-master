# Natural Disaster Management System

Disaster management system is a database system for collecting and reporting information related to natural disasters. In case of any natural disasters, people from the nearby affected area can report the incident. This incident can be stored in the database and can be reported to the government officials so that they can take appropriate actions. 
 
I have used C# (Visual Studio) and POSTGRESQL for this project.

To prevent registration of fake users, each user has to enter his aadhar number. The aadhar number atrribute has a UNIQUE key constraint.
